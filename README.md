# Welcome to Ansible 2221

This repository holds my Ansible documentation and scripts while I learn the Ansible platform during my time in the Cyber Defense Techniques (CSEC 473) course.
Project wide documentation will include my personal notes as I learn the platform, frequent commands and tips that I find helpful, as well as documentation for individual scripts.
This repository is for personal usage; however, it may be beneficial to others looking for examples or references.
