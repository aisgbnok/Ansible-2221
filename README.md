# Welcome to Ansible 473

This repository holds my Ansible documentation and scripts while I learn the Ansible platform during my time in the CSEC 473 course.
Project wide documentation will include my personal notes as I learn the platform, frequent commands and tips that I find helpful, as well as documentation for individual scripts.
This repository is for personal usage; however, it may be beneficial to others looking for examples or references.

*The CSEC 473 course teaches Cyber Defense Techniques.
This is done in a number of ways including participating in three in-house cybersecurity competitions over the course of the semester.*
